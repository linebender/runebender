//! Easier handling of mouse events.
//!
//! Handling the various permutations and combinations of mouse events is messy,
//! repetitive, and error prone.
//!
//! This module implements a state machine that handles the raw event processing,
//! identifying important events and transitions.
//!
//! # Use
//!
//! The state machine itself is exposed via the [`Mouse`] struct. You are
//! responsible for instantiating this struct, and it is expected to persist
//! between mouse events.
//!
//! To react to state changes, you must implement the [`MouseDelegate`] trait;
//! you only need to implement the methods you are interested in.
//!
//! When a mouse event arrives, you pass the event along with your delegate to
//! the [`Mouse`] struct; if that event causes a state change, the corresponding
//! method on your delegate will be called.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! use runebender::mouse::{Mouse, MouseDelegate};
//! use druid::shell::window::{MouseEvent, MouseButton, KeyModifiers};
//! use druid::kurbo::Point;
//!
//! struct SimpleDelegate(usize);
//!
//! impl MouseDelegate<()> for SimpleDelegate {
//!     fn left_click(&mut self, _event: &MouseEvent, _data: &mut T) -> bool {
//!         self.0 += 1;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let event = MouseEvent {
//!     pos: Point::new(20., 20.,),
//!     mods: KeyModifiers::None,
//!     count: 1,
//!     button: MouseButton::Left,
//! };
//!
//! let mut mouse = Mouse::default();
//! let mut delegate = SimpleDelegate(0);
//! mouse.mouse_down(event.clone(), &mut (), &mut delegate);
//! assert_eq!(delegate.0, 0);
//! mouse.mouse_up(event.clone(), &mut (), &mut delegate);
//! assert_eq!(delegate.0, 1);
//! ```
